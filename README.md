# StringEnhancerCpp

**StringEnhancerCpp** is a C++ library designed to enhance standard string manipulation capabilities. It offers advanced functions for processing strings, making it ideal for developers looking to expand the functionality of the native C++ string class.

## Features

- **Case Transformations**: Convert strings to uppercase, lowercase, or invert case.
- **Word Manipulation**: Reverse the order of words, change the casing of first letters.
- **Trimming**: Remove spaces from the left, right, or both sides of strings.
- **Counting Functions**: Count words, vowels, specific characters, as well as upper and lower case letters.
- **Splitting and Joining**: Divide strings into vectors of substrings and reconcatenate them.
- **Customizations**: Replace words and remove punctuations.

## Installation

Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. Here are some options:

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) for Linux.
- [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) for Windows.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/StringEnhancerCpp.git
cd StringEnhancerCpp
```

## Compile the program

```bash
g++ -o StringEnhancer main.cpp
```

## Usage

Run the program:

```bash
./StringEnhancer
```

Explore the various string manipulation functionalities by modifying `main.cpp` to utilize different methods from the `clsString` class.
